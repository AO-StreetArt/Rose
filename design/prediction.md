# Prediction

So on a basic level, we can predict that things we've seen before, we'll see again.

Even more reliable, is predicting that things we've seen multiple times before, we'll see again.  This is called deductive logic.

We accomplish this with tags and classification, and how many times we saw them over time.

Ideally, we'd be able to re-train the models on this new data, in an iterative approach.  This is much more of a long term vision though.
